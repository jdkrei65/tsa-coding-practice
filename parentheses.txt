PROBLEM 5 - PARENTHESES
Create a program that finds all of the groups of parentheses in a
given string. For the purpose of this problem, a parenthesis group is
zero or more characters inside parentheses - '(' and ')'.

Groups may contain any character, and other sub-groups - eg '( abc1 (2def))'

You may assume:
- The input contains only the characters a-z, A-Z, 0-9, and ( and )
- The input is less than 50 characters
- All opening parentheses will have a matching closing parenthesis
- The groups of parentheses will be nested no more than 10 groups deep

Your program should find all of the groups and sub groups, and print
all of the groups, including the parentheses, in left-to-right order
in which they appear.

SAMPLE TESTS
[Sample 1]
hi (how (are) you)?     <-- INPUT
(how (are) you)         <-- OUTPUT
(are)                   <-- OUTPUT

[Sample 2]
this (is a (nested) parentheses) ooh (what (the heck))?     <-- INPUT
(is a (nested) parentheses)                                 <-- OUTPUT
(nested)                                                    <-- OUTPUT
(what (the heck))                                           <-- OUTPUT
(the heck)                                                  <-- OUTPUT
